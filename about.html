											My name is Collin Stewart, a full-stack developer who is passionate about coding, developing, and getting involved in any new technology or development tools available.

											Since I was a child, I was always fascinated about computers. This fascination only grew as I got older and it is  what has led me to want to obtain a bachelorâ€™s in computer science and to become a developer in the future. For the last five years I have worked at different minimum wage jobs. I have also been going to school part-time the last three years. Working at these different jobs helped motivate me to do my best in school, so that I may be able to one day get a job that I am passionate about.

											After completing two years towards my major, I decided that I wanted to start my career as a developer. This desire is what led me to LearningFuze. LearningFuze is an accelerated web development program located in Orange County. During the program, I was coding over 70 hours a week and had the opportunity to work as a front-end developer on several applications. As a front-end developer, I was able to improve my knowledge in JavaScript, jQuery, and React. After the program ended, I have been continuously working on developing my own projects, improving my developer skills, and will be returning to school to complete my degree.
										</div>
										<br>
										<div class="minimized-width-text">
											The skills and knowledge I have gained as web developer would make a great asset to your team. I would love for the opportunity  to bring my passion and dedication to your company.
